Installation
============

0. Install Linux kernel that supports "u32" classifier (CONFIG_NET_CLS_U32),
traffic control actions (CONFIG_NET_CLS_ACT, CONFIG_NET_ACT_GACT), traffic
policing (CONFIG_NET_ACT_POLICE), and (optionally) "flow" classifier
(CONFIG_NET_CLS_FLOW).

1. Install Perl 5 and the following modules:
AppConfig, DBI, DBD-module for your database (DBD::Pg, DBD::SQLite,
DBD::mysql, etc), Getopt::Long, Pod::Usage, Term::ANSIColor, Sys::Syslog.

  a. Installation from package repository of your Linux distribution.

     Example for Debian:
     # aptitude install perl perl-base perl-doc perl-modules libdbi-perl \
	     libdbd-sqlite3-perl libappconfig-perl

  b. Installation of modules from CPAN.
     # cpan AppConfig DBI DBD::SQLite Getopt::Long Pod::Usage \
	     Term::ANSIColor Sys::Syslog

If you see that the output of "sc help" command is broken, please update
Pod::Usage module from CPAN.

2. Install iproute2 suite. The latest version from
<http://deversources.linuxfoundation.org/dev/iproute2/download> is preferred.

3. Install iptables and ipset <http://ipset.netfilter.org/> if you are
planning to use "flow" classifier.

5. Install sc, manpages, configuration file and init script.

# make install

SC comes with init script that is installed to location /etc/init.d/sc.

To enable autostart of shaper you should create symlinks in runlevel
directories. In Debian and related distributives you may use the following
command

# update-rc.d sc defaults


Configuration
=============

1. Database settings

By default, sc stores it's data in SQLite database at /etc/sc/sc.db, but it
can use any other DBI-compatible database server like MySQL, PostgreSQL or
Oracle. If you plan to load the data from a remote database on a dedicated
billing server, you must install corresponding Perl DBD module, configure
database driver and SQL-queries that will produce correct output for sc.
The first column must contain an IP-addresses in integer representation, and
the second column provides the integer bandwith rate values (see default value
of "query_create" parameter).

Rate units are defined by "rate_unit" parameter in sc.conf or by similar
command line option. Default rate unit is 1 Kibit/s = 1024 bit/s.

If you plan to use shaper with it's own SQLite database, you need to create it
and add some data.

# sc dbcreate
# sc dbadd 172.16.0.1 10Mibit
# sc dbadd 172.16.0.2 20Mibit

You may also use "genbase" script to generate some database entries with
random values of bandwidth rates.


2. Synchronization of rules with database

To perform synchronization of the shaping rules with the database you should
add a corresponding line to your crontab file. The following example creates
cron task which performs synchronization of rules every 10 minutes:

*/10 * * * * root /usr/local/sbin/sc sync

3. Syslog

SC can log errors and warnings through syslog. To enable this feature set
"syslog" option to 1 in /etc/sc/sc.conf.

Testing
=======

Source package includes "genbase" script that allows you to create database
with IP-addresses and random bandwidth rates.
