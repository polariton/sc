Installation
============

1. Install Perl 5 interpreter and the following modules: 
AppConfig, Getopt::Long, DBI, DBD-module for your database (DBD::mysql,
DBD::sqlite, etc), Pod::Usage.

a. Installation from repository of your Linux distribution (recommended way)

Example:
  apt-get install perl-doc perl-modules libdbi-perl libdbd-sqlite3-perl \
    libappconfig-perl

b. Installation from CPAN:
  cpan DBI DBD::SQLite DBD::Mysql Pod::Usage AppConfig

2. Install fresh iproute2 suite that supports "flow" classifier.

3. Install iptables.

4. Install ipset (http://ipset.netfilter.org/).

5. Install sc.
  make install

If you want to create shaping rules at startup and clear them at shutdown, you
should prepare init script. sc comes with such script for Debian-based
distributions. To install it just type
  cp sc.init /etc/init.d/sc

and don't forget to update rc.d symlinks.
  update-rc.d sc defaults


Configuration
=============

1. Database settings

By default, sc uses SQLite database /etc/sc/sc.db, but it can use any other
DBI-compatible database like MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle. You must enter
database queries that will produce correct output for sc. It is assumed that
IP-addresses and bandwidth rates are stored as integer numbers (see
query_create value). Default and recommended rate unit is 1 Kibit/s = 1024
bit/s. Remember that IP-addresses must differ in two last octets, because they
are used for deterministic mapping to a tc classid's.

If you plan to use shaper with it's own SQLite database, you need to create it
and add some data.

Example:
  sc dbcreate
  sc dbadd 172.16.0.1 10Mibit
  sc dbadd 172.16.0.2 20Mibit


2. Synchronization with database

To perform synchronization of shaping rules with database you should add
a corresponding line to your crontab file. In the following example
synchronization of rules will be performed every 10 minutes.

*/10 * * * * root /usr/local/sbin/sc sync


3. Syslog

sc can log it's errors and warnings through syslog. To turn on this
feature, set the "syslog" option to 1 in /etc/sc/sc.conf.
