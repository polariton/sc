# Rate limiting method
#
# Possible values: shaping, policing or hybrid

# Network list for classid calculation

# the specified networks should be 65533 or less. E.g. it is allowed to use

# Network list for hashing filters generation
#
# The principle is the same as for route aggregation: one can specify a large
# network (e.g. 10.0.0.0/16), which includes a few smaller subnets
# (10.0.0.0/20 and 10.0.254.0/24).
#
# For simplicity of filter hash table numbers calculation, the maximum number
# of different entries in this list is set to 255.

# Ratio between the policer buffer size and bandwidth rate

# Warning: always test the resulting bandwidth. If the buffer size is too
# large or too small, you may not obtain the correct bitrates.

# Amount of bytes a stream is allowed to dequeue before the next queue gets a

# Default value: kibit.
# Possible values: see sc(8) or tc(8) manpage.
rate_unit = kibit

# Ratio between bandwidth rates in the rules and in the database.
